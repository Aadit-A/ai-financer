# AI Finance Advisor

This project is a personal finance management application designed to help users track their income and expenses, manage savings goals, and gain insights into their spending habits through AI-powered analysis.

## Aim of the Project

The primary goal of this application is to provide users with a smart and intuitive tool for managing their personal finances. By leveraging AI, it aims to offer more than just simple transaction tracking, providing automated classification of expenses to help users understand their spending patterns and make more informed financial decisions.

## What it Does

### Financial Management
- **Track Transactions:** Users can add income and expense transactions, assigning categories to each.
- **Manage Savings Goals:** The application allows users to create and monitor multiple savings goals. It provides templates for common goals (like saving for a car or a house) and visualizes progress.
- **Real-time Overview:** The dashboard displays the user's current balance, total income, and total expenses.

### AI-Powered Expense Analysis
- **Smart Classification:** An AI model analyzes each expense and categorizes it as "Necessary" or "Unnecessary". This helps users identify where their money is going.
- **Contextual Analysis:** Users can provide additional context for an expense to improve the accuracy of the AI's classification.

### Dashboard and Analytics
- **Financial Snapshot:** The dashboard presents key statistics, such as total transactions and top spending categories.
- **Data Filtering and Sorting:** Users can filter transactions by type, category, or date, and sort them by date or amount.
