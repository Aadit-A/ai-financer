## Phase 1 - Wireframes & UI Design ✅

### Current Status: Wireframe Phase
This phase focuses on creating simple wireframes and UI sketches to plan the application layout and user experience before implementing full functionality.

### Wireframe Components
- **Login Wireframe**: Simple authentication interface layout
- **Dashboard Wireframe**: Main financial overview with placeholder content
- **Navigation Flow**: Visual representation of user journey
- **Mobile Layout**: Responsive design considerations
- **Future Features**: Planning for Phase 2+ enhancements

### Key Features Planned
1. **Login System**
   - Username/password form
   - Simple navigation to dashboard
   - No authentication logic (wireframe only)

2. **Financial Dashboard**
   - Income, Expenses, Balance overview cards
   - Savings goal progress indicator
   - Transaction entry form layout
   - Recent transactions list

3. **User Experience**
   - Clean, intuitive interface design
   - Mobile-responsive layout planning
   - Consistent visual hierarchy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`

### Viewing Wireframes
1. The app loads with a comprehensive wireframe overview
2. Use the "Test Login Wireframe" and "Test Dashboard Wireframe" buttons to interact with individual wireframes
3. Navigate between views to understand the planned user flow

## Wireframe Features

### 1. Wireframe Overview Page
- Complete visual guide to all planned UI components
- Interactive buttons to test individual wireframes
- Mobile layout considerations
- Future feature planning

### 2. Login Wireframe
- Simple form layout with placeholder fields
- Navigation flow demonstration
- Clean, centered design approach

### 3. Dashboard Wireframe
- Financial overview cards layout
- Progress indicators and visual elements
- Form placement and organization
- Transaction list structure

### 4. Responsive Design Planning
- Mobile-first approach considerations
- Grid system planning
- Component stacking for smaller screens

## Technology Stack

### Frontend (Wireframes)
- **React 19.1.1** - Component framework
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **CSS3** - Wireframe styling with dashed borders
- **Monospace Font** - Emphasizes wireframe/sketch nature

### Design Approach
- Dashed borders to indicate wireframe elements
- Placeholder text in brackets [Like This]
- Monospace typography for technical feel
- Color coding for different element types
- Interactive elements with hover states

## Wireframe Benefits

1. **Early Planning**: Visualize layout before coding complex logic
2. **Stakeholder Review**: Easy to share and get feedback on design
3. **Development Roadmap**: Clear path for implementation phases
4. **Responsive Design**: Plan mobile layouts early
5. **Feature Scope**: Understand what fits in each phase

## Next Development Phases

### Phase 2 - Basic Implementation
- Convert wireframes to functional components
- Add state management and form handling
- Implement basic calculations and data flow
- Add form validation and user feedback

### Phase 3 - Backend Integration
- User authentication system
- Database integration
- Data persistence
- API development

### Phase 4 - AI Features
- Financial analysis and insights
- Spending pattern recognition
- Budget recommendations
- Predictive analytics
